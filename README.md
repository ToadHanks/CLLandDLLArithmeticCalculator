Instructions
-------------   
This projet implements a linked list based arithmetic calculator. The calculator will be able to perform addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. The calculator will keep a running total of the operations completed, the number of operations completed,
and what those operations were. The calculator will also have an "undo" function for removing the last operation. The calculator will 
also be able to output a string of the operations completed so far with fixed precision.

This project includes an abstract class for the CalcList from which to inherit (Author: William Oropallo). This abstract class
(CalcListInterface) contains the pure virtual version of all the required methods. This file also includes a typedef of an enum 
used for the four arithmetic functions called FUNCTIONS.  

Furthermore, this project is tested using the Catch2 (https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) test framework. This framework
only requires that a program include the header to run the test file. For your convenience, this project contains the Catch2 header.

The calculator (which is called “CalcList”) is implemented using a doubly, and circularly linked list. Calculator implements these
four methods:  

  - *double total() const*   
       This method returns the current total of the CalcList. Total should run as a constant time operation. The program should 
       not have to iterate through the entire list each time the total is needed. 

  - *void newOperation(const FUNCTIONS func, const double operand)*     
       Adds an operation to the CalcList and creates a new total. The operation alters total by using the function with the 
       operand. Example: newOperation(ADDITION, 10) => adds 10 to the total. 

  - *void removeLastOperation()*      
      Removes the last operation from the calc list and restores the previous total. 

  - *std::string toString(unsigned short precision) const*     
      Returns a string of the list of operations completed so far formatted with a fixed point precision. The form of the 
      string is: "(step): (totalAtStep)(Function)(operand) = (newTotal) \n". 
      Example: toString(2) => "3: 30.00*1.00=30.00\n2: 10.00+20.00=30.00\n1: 0.00+10.00=10.00\n"        
    
Please use test file CalcListTest.cpp to test your given input. 
      
Examples   
--------   
Below are some examples of how this code runs. The test file can also be used to get an idea of how the code can run. 
````````cpp
CalcList calc;                        // Total == 0      
calc.newOperation(ADDITION, 10);      // Total == 10    
calc.newOperation(MULTIPLICATION, 5); // Total == 50     
calc.newOperation(SUBTRACTION, 15);   // Total == 35    
calc.newOperation(DIVISION, 7);       // Total == 5    
calc.removeLastOperation();           // Total == 35    
calc.newOperation(SUBTRACTION, 30);   // Total == 5   
calc.newOperation(ADDITION, 5);       // Total == 10   
calc.removeLastOperation();           // Total == 5   
// Should Return:   
// 4: 35.00-30.00=5.00   
// 3: 50.00-15.00=35.00   
// 2: 10.00*5.00=50.00   
// 1: 0.00+10.00=10.00   
std::cout << calc.toString(2);    
calc.removeLastOperation();           // Total == 35    
// Should Return:   
// 3: 50-15=35   
// 2: 10*5=50   
// 1: 0+10=10   
std::cout << calc.toString(0);
